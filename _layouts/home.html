<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>

  I'm Mark, an AI engineer, researcher, and systems builder working at the intersection of machine learning, social behavior, and automation.
At Northwestern, I lead engineering for machine learning research on social platforms. I study how AI systems and social media algorithms interact with human psychology and sociology to shape social learning, moral perception, and collective behavior online. My work integrates computational modeling, large-scale social data analysis, recommender systems, and ML algorithms to understand how digital platforms influence what people perceive as normal, moral, or socially desirable. By combining social theory with technical implementation, I approach social media as both a psychological and algorithmic system, one that can be empirically studied and computationally redesigned to promote healthier discourse.
In parallel, I work at the intersection of AI research and methodology, developing and evaluating large language models as tools for computational social science. I build LLM-based simulations of social behavior, design evaluation frameworks to assess model validity and bias, and explore how generative AI can extend the methodological frontier of social science research. Together, these lines of work aim to create a deeper understanding of how humanâ€“AI systems coevolve and how we can engineer them to strengthen, rather than erode, online social ecosystems.
Outside academia, I consult with teams across industries, helping startups, researchers, and organizations turn AI ideas into working systems. I've shipped AI agents that automate lead generation and outreach, prototype LLM tools for marketing and analysis, and build pipelines that transform raw behavioral data into actionable insight.
I care about engineering that moves the needle, systems that are fast, flexible, and grounded in real-world use. Whether it's an agent, a ranking model, or a pipeline, I build with the goal of making AI more usable, explainable, and impactful.
