# Experimenting with DSPy, Pt. I
As part of me learning more about LLMs, I'm working through different use cases, tools, and examples that I find online. Right now, I'm learning about [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy). This notebook will walk through the intro "Hello World" [example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/intro.ipynb) from the DSPy Github repo. My own version is in [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vQH4AiNXHGVg1xTK8w5PmhQh6mlGsJk8) notebook.
