# Experimenting with DSPy, Pt. I
As part of me learning more about LLMs, I'm working through different use cases, tools, and examples that I find online. Right now, I'm learning about [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy). This notebook will walk through the intro "Hello World" [example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/intro.ipynb) from the DSPy Github repo. My own version is in [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vQH4AiNXHGVg1xTK8w5PmhQh6mlGsJk8) notebook.

## Overview of DSPy
[more setup]

DSPy

## Working through a "Hello World" example from the DSPy docs
We'll be following the example [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/intro.ipynb) from the DSPy docs. [Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vQH4AiNXHGVg1xTK8w5PmhQh6mlGsJk8) is my version of the notebook.

### Setup
First, we'll install the necessary packages:
```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2

import sys
import os

try: # When on google Colab, let's clone the notebook so we download the cache.
    import google.colab
    repo_path = 'dspy'
    !git -C $repo_path pull origin || git clone https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy $repo_path
except:
    repo_path = '.'

if repo_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(repo_path)

# Set up the cache for this notebook
os.environ["DSP_NOTEBOOK_CACHEDIR"] = os.path.join(repo_path, 'cache')

import pkg_resources # Install the package if it's not installed
if not "dspy-ai" in {pkg.key for pkg in pkg_resources.working_set}:
    !pip install -U pip
    !pip install dspy-ai
    !pip install openai~=0.28.1
    # !pip install -e $repo_path

import dspy
```
