# Session II: Questioning Barbie and Oppenheimer Through the Use of Agents (and deploy as a Gradio app)
I'm working on improving my RAG-building skills. As a part of that, I'm taking courses online. The course I'm currently taking is from [AI Makerspace](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space), as part of their [LLMOps](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/LLM-Ops-Cohort-1) curriculum.

The related project notebook is [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/LLM-Ops-Cohort-1/blob/main/Week%201/Thursday/Agent%20Powered%20Barbenheimer%20Application%20(Assignment%20Version).ipynb), and my own version of that notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q6NZYUOcplDcAJFJAXMtFh-my73wOzjg).

## Setup

## Contruct a Barbie retriever

## Construct an Oppenheimer retriever

## Combine the two and allow users to query both resources from a single input through the use of Agents

## Deploy as a Gradio app
