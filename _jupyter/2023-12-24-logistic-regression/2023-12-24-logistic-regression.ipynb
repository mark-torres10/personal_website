    "# Detecting credit card fraud using logistic regression: Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll create a model that will help us detect credit card fraud. This is a classic application of machine learning that is illustrative of the type of work that goes into creating a useful machine learning model. We will then host this as an API endpoint using Google Cloud (in Part II). We'll also create an end-to-end ML pipeline for model training, experimentation, deployment, and monitoring (using [this repo](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp) as a running resource) (in Part III).\n"

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud detection is a classic example of a problem solved using classification algorithms. It's a good case study in basic machine learning development for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Real-world applications: Credit card fraud detection is a real-world problem.\n",
    "2. Feature engineering: To make credit card data useful, it has to be transformed and manipulatedin various ways.\n",
    "3. Imbalanced datasets: credit card fraud is (thankfully) a relatively rare occurrence, so detecting fraud requires managing imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "4. Interpretability: since this problem is within a non-technical domain (finance), working on this project in industry will likely require talking with non-ML people. These people will likely be very interested in not only a model that can predict fraud, but also what the model looks for when it detects fraud. Therefore, we want a model that is interpretable.\n"
