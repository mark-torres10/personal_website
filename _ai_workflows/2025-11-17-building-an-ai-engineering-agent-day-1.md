# Building an AI Engineering Agent, Day 1: Bootstrapping on Titanic

I'm working on building an AI agent that can automate data science and ML engineering tasks. Not only is this an unsolved problem (though lots of people are working on it), it's also a great way to learn how to build good, useful agents.

I'm starting with the Titanic dataset. I chose this dataset because:
- It's pretty simple. It's one of the first datasets you work with when learning data science.
- The actual solution is pretty well-known: absent of some feature engineering, the task is pretty simple.
