# Using AI agents to plan my work week

At the start of my work week, I look through all my notes and actionable items from the past 1-2 weeks and I figure out what's actionable based on them. But recently, I migrated my notes away from Notion and into Markdown files that can be indexed with Cursor.

Now I ask Cursor to help do that same task. I get it to scan my notes from the past 1-2 weeks and help me accumulate the tasks and put them in an Eisenhower matrix.

GPT-5 does a great job at doing this task.

I asked the LLM to then add more context to each item.

I then ask the LLM to create a day-by-day task list based on this Eisenhower matrix.

This is one way that I now use LLMs and agents to help expedite my current workflows.
