# Why writing your own prompt library is a competitive advantage

(... intro here ...)

I have [my own extensive prompt library](https://github.com/mark-torres10/ai_tools/tree/main), refined by deeply evaluating themes across my work, which helps augment my own intelligence by systematizing common workflows, questions that I ask, and guidelines for what "high quality" AI outputs look like.

(As you build your own prompts, you create your own personal "prompt library". This has MANY benefits, including:)

## Benefit 1: Being a part of your own proprietary AI secret sauce

As you experiment and create prompts, you create your own internal repository that becomes a part of your edge. These prompts become a part of how you get your results and are prompts that your competitors don't have.

For my work, I find that I can systematically define how I, for example, prototype MVPs quickly, develop and ship certain features, do due diligence, and learn new topics quickly using AI, and all of those are key parts of my workflow now all amplified by AI.

## Benefit 2: Gives you a set of prompts for different use cases

Some clients I've worked with have folders to organize their prompts, and then when they need to do a specific type of task, such as due diligence or analyzing reports, they go to that folder and they just copy and paste those same prompts into ChatGPT.

## Benefit 3: Lets you build your own "test" to test against any new LLMs

New versions of ChatGPT and other LLMs come out all the time, and there's so much hype and press around how these LLMs are now smarter than humans, curing diseases, automating away everyone's jobs, and so on. AI companies all have their [own internal prompts](https://openai.com/index/gdpval/) that they use to test any new LLM, and so should you. Having your own personal prompt library helps you get past the fluff and see when a new LLM actually does better for your specific use case.

## How to organize your prompt library

Here are some tips for how to organize your prompt library:

- **By use case:** Create folders/categories for different types of tasks (e.g., "Content Creation", "Data Analysis", "Email Drafting").
- **By department:** If you work across teams, organize by function (Marketing, Sales, Finance).
- **Version control:** Keep track of which version of a prompt works best. Note what changed between versions. Version control also exists natively in Google Docs (you can see the history of revisions) as well as in tools like Git (for the technically inclined).
- **Metadata:** For each prompt, document:
  - What it does
  - What inputs it needs
  - What outputs to expect
  - When to use it vs. alternatives
  - Known limitations or edge cases

## Tools for organizing a prompt library

- Simple: Google Docs, Notion, or even a text file
- Advanced: Dedicated prompt management tools (though these might be overkill at the start)

## Use your prompt library to test out new LLMs

When a new LLM version comes out (ChatGPT-5, Claude 4, etc.), don't just read the press releases. Test it yourself:

1. Take 5-10 prompts from your library that represent your core use cases
2. Run them on the new LLM with the same inputs you've used before
3. Compare outputs side-by-side with previous versions
4. Document: Is it better? Worse? Different in ways that matter?

This gives you real, actionable data about whether the upgrade is worth it for *your* work, not just whether it's better at math competitions. It also helps you separate hype from reality and to tune out AI snake oil salesmen and FOMO.
