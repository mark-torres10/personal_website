# Being AI-first: non-technical workflows

Right now I'm working on securing grant funding for projects in 2026. Instead of approaching this traditionally, I'm using AI workflows throughout the entire process. Here's how I'm being AI-first in a non-technical domain.

## Use case 1: Have ChatGPT summarize my research interests

I fed ChatGPT all my recent blog posts, research papers, and project descriptions. Instead of manually synthesizing my interests, I asked it to identify patterns and create a coherent narrative about my research focus. This saved hours of reflection and gave me a starting point that I could then refine.

The AI output was surprisingly insightful. It identified that my work centers around "AI-augmented research workflows" and "empirical evaluation of AI tools in academic contexts" - themes I hadn't explicitly articulated before. It generated a summary like: "Your research demonstrates a systematic approach to integrating AI tools into academic workflows, with particular focus on creating reproducible evaluation frameworks and developing AI expert personas for domain-specific tasks."

This approach is dramatically different from how I'd normally handle this. Traditionally, I'd spend days re-reading my own work, trying to manually extract themes, and often getting lost in the details. The AI gave me a bird's-eye view that I could then validate and refine, rather than starting from scratch. It's like having a research assistant who's read everything you've written and can immediately spot the throughlines you might miss when you're too close to the work.

## Use case 2: Having AI agents do lit reviews

I created an AI expert trained on academic literature review best practices. I gave it my research questions and it systematically searched for relevant papers, summarized key findings, and identified gaps in the literature. The AI expert followed a structured rubric for evaluating paper relevance and quality.

## Use case 3: Analyze and break down examples of project proposals online

I found several successful grant proposals online and had Claude analyze their structure, language patterns, and argumentation strategies. It identified common elements like problem framing, methodology justification, and impact statements, then created a template based on these patterns.

## Use case 4: Refine and iterate on my project ideas

I used AI to play devil's advocate with my initial ideas. I prompted it to identify weaknesses, suggest alternative approaches, and challenge my assumptions. This iterative feedback loop helped me strengthen my proposals before even writing the first draft.

## Use case 5: Have AI agents write out a proposed outline

Based on the successful proposal patterns and my refined ideas, I had an AI agent create a detailed outline. It included section headers, key points to cover, and suggested word counts for each section. This gave me a clear roadmap for writing.

## Use case 6: Have AI agents write out a first draft

Using the outline and my research materials, I had an AI agent write initial drafts for each section. The key was providing it with specific examples, data points, and quotes from my previous work to ground the writing in my actual expertise.

## Use case 7: Have AI agents double-check my reasoning as I write

As I wrote my own sections, I had an AI agent review each paragraph for logical consistency, evidence quality, and argument strength. It flagged weak points and suggested improvements in real-time.

## Use case 8: Having AI agents trained on specific personas give pointed feedback on my drafts

I created different AI experts representing typical grant reviewers: a technical expert, a funding administrator, and a domain specialist. Each provided targeted feedback from their perspective, helping me anticipate and address different types of concerns.

## Use case 9: Have the AI agents search as a mock grant reviewal committee for my proposal

Finally, I had the AI experts simulate a grant review committee meeting. They discussed my proposal, raised concerns, and voted on funding. This stress-tested my arguments and revealed areas that needed strengthening before submission.

## Conclusion

Being AI-first doesn't mean replacing human judgmentâ€”it means leveraging AI to amplify your capabilities. I still made all the final decisions, but AI accelerated every step of the process. The key was creating structured workflows and using AI experts with specific expertise rather than relying on generic AI responses.

This approach isn't limited to grant writing. You can apply similar workflows to any complex, multi-step task where you need research, analysis, writing, and review capabilities.
