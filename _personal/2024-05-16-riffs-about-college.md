# Riffs about the value of higher education
I'm lucky enough to have gone to college at a Ivy League school on a full scholarship. It definitely changed my life and I'm not sure where I would be without it.

But, my brother didn't go to college, and him not going has made me want to do more critical thinking around the question of "is college worth it?".

I think that my thoughts about this have evolved over time. I think that, having gone to college myself, it's always easier to see the "grass is greener on the other side" argument, where I think about the opportunity cost of having gone instead of being grateful for what I have because of it. Being in tech also skews that opinion, since tech isn't gatekept by a university degree; it's much easier to get noticed if you have a college degree, but it's also much easier to get noticed if you, say, developed a popular app or made contributions to open-source. Tech also has the characteristic of being (generally) pretty meritocratic; if a developer is better, they're better, regardless of name-brand school. I think I felt this frustration early on

I think it's only with time that I've begun to better appreciate the benefits of a college education broadly and an Ivy League education specifically.


But, everything is infinitely easier when you have a college degree, especially an Ivy League degree. People look at you differently, and there's a respect conferred on you, as if it's society marking you as "someone who's not a bum after all".

But,

I think my current conclusion is this:
> If a person can't make a higher education worth it, 99% of the time it's a skill issue.

(Obvious) caveats:
- I mean higher education in general. Community college is great and provides a quality education at a fraction of the cost, and people should really be going to those more often. Trade schools are also great and provide a much more direct connection of education to job-related skills.
- This doesn't mean taking on \$100,000-\$250,000 in debt to go to a private university. Again, there are many cheaper options, such as community college and trade school, that should be more embraced. I personally think that the rising cost of college is an unregulated grift and a scam, and people are rightfully upset at the high cost. However, the horror stories of taking on six figures in debt are overblown I think. You can get a quality education for much cheaper, and 99% of higher education options worth considering are much cheaper in my opinion.
- There are people who genuinely shouldn't be going to college.
    - If you're an athlete, I can see the value of going professional. However, 99% of athletes in D1 programs (and even more at lower levels) aren't going to be able to meaningfully and profitably pursue their athletic careers. Plus education is a 
    - For other skills
    - For entrepreneurial types, (). But >99% of entrepreneurs fail, and the stories that we hear of entrepreneurs successfully dropping of college can generally be attributed to survivorship bias, plus many entrepreneurs who do drop out and succeed drop out only after making a calculated decision that their pursuit is worth the risk. Yes, Mark Zuckerberg dropped out, but 99.9999% of people aren't as talented as Mark Zuckerberg, and he dropped out of *Harvard*, not a random ordinary school.

Some pros 

I think there are generally 4 paths:
- Community college
- Trade school
- 2 years at community college + 2 years at university
- Top-tier university (Ivy League, adjacent schools)
