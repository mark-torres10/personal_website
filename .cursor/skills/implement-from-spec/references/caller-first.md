# Caller-First Scoping

Apply in Phase 1. Goal: name one main caller and one unit-of-work slice before scaffolding.

## What is the main caller?

How this change will be used by whatever calls or uses it. Typically:

- A single function plugged into a flow
- A class constructed and used from `main.py` / `__main__`
- A route handler, job entrypoint, CLI command, or workflow step

Ask: *“If we only finish one path, which entrypoint proves the design works?”*

## How to pick the unit of work

1. State the happy path through the caller in plain English (e.g. load → transform → write).
2. List the functions/methods that path needs.
3. The session slice is that path (or one plan packet that owns it)—not every edge case in the design doc.
4. Defer alternate entrypoints, admin tools, and unrelated modules to out-of-scope.

## Dependency order (for Phase 5)

Implement units along the caller path’s dependency order, not “easiest file first”:

1. Leaves the caller needs first (e.g. repository `get`)
2. Then siblings the path needs (e.g. `write`, then `transform`)
3. Close the caller last (e.g. `run`) once dependencies behave

See [../examples/pipeline-memory-repo.md](../examples/pipeline-memory-repo.md).

## Output of Phase 1

Produce a short scope block:

```markdown
## Scope
- Caller: `pipeline/main.py` → `run(repo, record_id)`
- Slice: load → transform → write via MemoryRepository
- Files: models.py, repository.py, transform.py, main.py, tests/test_pipeline.py
- Out of scope: real DB, CLI flags, batch mode
```

## Anti-patterns

- Starting with “shared utils” with no caller
- Scaffolding five services before naming who invokes them
- Treating the whole design doc as one undivided implementation session
