# Contracts Only

Apply in Phase 3. Confirm models, interfaces, and boundaries without behavior.

## What to define

- Data models / schemas (e.g. Pydantic `BaseModel`, dataclasses, types)
- Repository / port interfaces and concrete class signatures
- Function signatures the caller will invoke
- Error types the design specifies (as types or documented raises)—not full handlers yet

## What is allowed in bodies

- `...` / `pass` / `raise NotImplementedError`
- Trivial constructors that only hold empty state (e.g. `self._store: dict = {}`)
- Caller wiring that calls stubs in the correct order (typed shape), still without real logic inside callees

## What is forbidden

- Transform / business rules
- Persistence behavior beyond empty containers
- Validation logic beyond what the type system already enforces
- Helper functions with real implementations “for later”

## Alignment with the design

- Field names and types must match the design/spec for this slice.
- If you must diverge, state the divergence explicitly and get approval with the contracts.

## Approval gate

Default: stop after Phase 3 and present contracts (file list + key signatures) for user approval.

Skip approval only if the user said full auto, unattended, or explicitly waived the pause.

Commit contracts as their own Git commit after approval (or after an explicit waiver).

## Anti-patterns

- “While defining the repo, I’ll just implement `get`”
- Fat interfaces that include methods not needed by this caller slice
- Premature abstract base classes when one concrete type suffices for the slice
