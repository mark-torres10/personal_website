# Hi!

  I'm Mark, an AI engineer, researcher, and systems builder. As a research engineer, I combine social sciences with AI tools, AI agents, and large-scale algorithms to study social media platforms and computationally redesign them to promote healthier discourse.
  In parallel, I work at the intersection of AI research and methodology, developing and evaluating large language models as tools for computational social science. Outside academia,
  I also consult with teams across industries, helping startups, researchers, and organizations turn AI ideas into working systems.
  I believe the future of AI isn't about replacing human judgment, but about amplifying us through human-AI workflows that allow us to use the best of both worlds to solve real-world problems.

## Current: Lead AI Engineer @Northwestern (2023-present)

Building applied AI systems for social media research and computational social science.

- Leading development of an **AI agent simulation platform** to study information flow, opinion dynamics, and influence on digital platforms — a modular, “custom AI-powered Facebook simulator” for academic use.  
- Creating **open-source tools** that provide scalable, reproducible access to millions of social media records for research teams studying behavior, ideology, and discourse online.  
- Designing and prototyping **large-scale, AI-driven feed ranking algorithms** for experimental studies in political and social influence.  
- Bridging ML engineering with academic research by owning data pipelines, modeling infrastructure, and real-time recommendation engines used across lab projects.
