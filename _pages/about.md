# Hi!

I'm Mark — an AI generalist and ML engineer with one foot in research and the other in production. At Northwestern, I lead AI and ML engineering for academic work on online behavior and influence. In my consulting practice, I help teams apply machine learning and LLMs to real-world problems—building tools, agents, and infrastructure that automate, augment, or accelerate their work. I bridge research and engineering to help teams ship smart, scalable systems. My focus is simple: solve real problems with real systems that ship.

## Current: Lead AI Engineer @Northwestern (2023-present)

Building applied AI systems for social media research and computational social science.

- Leading development of an **AI agent simulation platform** to study information flow, opinion dynamics, and influence on digital platforms — a modular, “custom AI-powered Facebook simulator” for academic use.  
- Creating **open-source tools** that provide scalable, reproducible access to millions of social media records for research teams studying behavior, ideology, and discourse online.  
- Designing and prototyping **large-scale, AI-driven feed ranking algorithms** for experimental studies in political and social influence.  
- Bridging ML engineering with academic research by owning data pipelines, modeling infrastructure, and real-time recommendation engines used across lab projects.
