# Bridging Cutting-Edge AI Advancements with Real-World Business Impact

I transform theoretical AI advancements into practical, measurable business outcomes. With experience spanning Silicon Valley startups and research at institutions like Yale and Northwestern, I deliver solutions that combine academic rigor with commercial pragmatism. I help companies adopt the latest advances in AI agents, RAG, and LLMs, to their use cases in order to drive business value.

## I work with leaders who:

* **Struggle to measure the ROI of their AI investments** - I help implement meaningful metrics beyond accuracy and show how to measure AI performance to drive business value.

* **Lack ML expertise but are interested in building AI-powered products** - With experience from building large-scale ML systems in Silicon Valley and in cutting-edge research universities like Yale University and Northwestern University, I provide hands-on training and knowledge transfer for engineering teams.

* **Want AI features that drive business value** - I help transform existing products into AI-enabled solutions that solve real user problems, not just showcase capabilities.

* **Need to scale AI systems cost-effectively** - Drawing from my experience optimizing large-scale systems, I help design architectures that balance performance with operational costs.

## What I Can Do For You

### Machine Learning & AI

* **AI Agents**: End-to-end development of autonomous AI agents that automate complex workflows, generate content, and manage interactions—delivering up to 70% time savings on routine tasks.

* **RAG Applications**: Custom retrieval-augmented generation systems that combine your proprietary data with LLMs, resulting in highly accurate, context-aware responses for chatbots and knowledge bases.

* **Large Language Model (LLM) Applications**: Strategic implementation of LLMs into your products with custom fine-tuning, evaluation frameworks, and cost-optimized architectures.

* **ML Algorithm Development**: Custom algorithm design using supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches tailored to your specific data characteristics and business constraints.

* **Model Optimization**: Performance tuning that improves accuracy while reducing inference costs—typically achieving 30-50% cost reduction without performance degradation.

* **Data Pipeline Engineering**: Scalable, fault-tolerant data workflows that handle evolving data needs while maintaining performance under increasing load.

### Backend Development

* **Scalable System Architecture**: Systems designed for growth, with clear migration paths from MVP to enterprise scale.

* **Database Optimization**: Performance tuning across SQL, NoSQL, and vector database systems, with particular expertise in cost-effective scaling patterns.

* **API Development**: Clean, well-documented, and versioned APIs that enable seamless integration and future extensibility.

* **Microservice Architecture**: Strategically decomposed services that balance team autonomy with system cohesion.

### Research & Analysis

* **Experimental Design**: Methodologically sound research frameworks that produce reliable, actionable insights.

* **Statistical Analysis**: Rigorous statistical approaches that extract meaningful patterns while avoiding common analytical pitfalls.

* **Research Implementation**: Translation of academic advances into production-ready implementations with appropriate trade-offs for business contexts.

## What Sets Me Apart

* **Research-to-Production Expertise**: I don't just understand papers—I implement them in production environments that need to work reliably at scale.

* **Full-Stack AI Understanding**: From data pipelines to model architecture to business integration, I address the entire AI implementation lifecycle.

* **Outcome-Focused Approach**: Every technical decision is evaluated against its impact on business metrics and user experience.

* **Rapid Prototyping to Production**: I build quick proofs-of-concept that can evolve into robust production systems without complete rewrites.
