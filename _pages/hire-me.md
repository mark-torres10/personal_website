# Consulting & AI Engineering Support

I help teams move fast with applied machine learning and AI systems.

Whether you’re a startup building your first AI product, a research lab developing ML infrastructure, or a business looking to automate workflows with LLMs—I bring the engineering experience and systems thinking to make it happen.

## What I Offer

- **LLM Applications & AI Agents**  
  I build custom GPT-style agents, retrieval pipelines, and task automation tools tailored to your workflows.

- **AI Strategy & Prototyping**  
  I work with teams to scope high-leverage use cases, rapidly prototype new features, or audit existing AI systems.

- **Recommendation & Ranking Systems**  
  I help teams develop models to personalize feeds, rank leads, and prioritize actions using behavior or business data.

- **ML Infrastructure & Pipelines**  
  From ingestion to inference, I design, optimize, and productionize end-to-end ML systems.

## Who I've Helped

- Small businesses automating sales and marketing and admin workflows through AI agents. Projects include:
  - A [lead qualification AI agent](https://github.com/mark-torres10/lead-generation-agent) that filters and triages inbound leads in real time—reducing response time to under 10 minutes and routing with over 90% accuracy.
  - A [CRM-updating agent](https://github.com/mark-torres10/lead-generation-agent) that automatically syncs lead data with <30s latency to keep contact records up-to-date.
  - A [meeting-scheduling agent](https://github.com/mark-torres10/lead-generation-agent) that follows up with qualified leads and books meetings—converting 42% of routed leads to scheduled calls.
  - A [copywriting AI agent](https://github.com/mark-torres10/copywriting-ai-agent) that writes tailored marketing copy based on a customer's own branding.
  - An [campaign analyzer AI agent](https://github.com/mark-torres10/campaign-agent-analyzer-n8n) that scores Google Ads campaigns and flags underperformance..
  - An [social content AI generator](https://github.com/mark-torres10/restaurant_marketing_agent) that drafts Facebook, Instagram, and email blasts for local businesses..
- SaaS and consumer applications looking for how to power their products with AI. One example includes integrating cutting-edge voice and video AI models to create [custom AI avatars](https://github.com/mark-torres10/ai_voice_visual_avatar_agent).
- Product and engineering teams integrating LLMs into internal tools and customer-facing platforms.
- Academic labs researching online behavior, political expression, and social media influence.
- Civic and policy-focused organizations applying AI to large-scale behavioral and demographic data using LLMs and predictive models.

## How I Work

Most projects start with a **1-week scoped sprint** focused on a clearly defined goal.  
At the end of the sprint, you'll walk away with a working prototype, demo, or system component you can evaluate and build on. From there, we can continue into a longer-term engagement or handoff—whatever fits your needs.
