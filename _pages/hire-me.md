# AI & Backend Development Consulting

I offer specialized consulting services in machine learning (including cutting-edge work such as LLMs, AI agents, and RAG applications), data science, and backend development. I've helped build ML and LLM powered applications in Silicon Valley and in cutting-edge AI research universities like Yale University and Northwestern University. I've built AI-powered applications that have been used by thousands of users. With experience ranging from early-stage startups to cutting-edge AI research, I bring a versatile skill set to help your projects succeed.

## I work with leaders like you who:

* **Struggle to measure AI performance** - I help implement meaningful metrics beyond accuracy, focusing on business outcomes that matter to your users.

* **Need faster iteration cycles** - I accelerate your testing from weeks to days, enabling 3-5x faster experimentation and 20-40% improved metrics.

* **Lack ML expertise on their team** - With experience from building large-scale ML systems in Silicon Valley and in cutting-edge research universities like Northwestern University and Yale, I provide hands-on training and knowledge transfer for engineering teams.

* **Want AI features that drive business value** - I help transform existing products into AI-enabled solutions that solve real user problems, not just showcase capabilities.

* **Need reliable ML systems** - I embed with your team to identify bottlenecks, implement robust feedback loops, and replace intuition with data-driven decisions.

## What I Can Do For You

### Machine Learning & AI
- **Large Language Model (LLM) Applications**: End-to-end development of LLM-powered systems
- **RAG Applications**: End-to-end development of RAG-powered systems for things like chatbots and search.
- **ML Algorithm Development**: Custom algorithm design and implementation
- **Model Optimization**: Improve existing models for better performance and efficiency
- **Data Pipeline Engineering**: Build robust, scalable data processing systems

### Backend Development
- **Scalable System Architecture**: Design systems that can grow with your needs
- **Database Optimization**: At various scales, I can help optimize for your use case
- **API Development**: API design and implementation
- **Microservice Architecture**: Design and implementation of decoupled service architectures

### Research & Analysis
- **Experimental Design**: Robust methodology for testing hypotheses
- **Statistical Analysis**: Rigorous data analysis to extract meaningful insights
- **Research Implementation**: Translating academic research into practical applications

## Why Work With Me

- **Proven Track Record**: My experience spans from Silicon Valley startups to cutting-edge AI research.
- **Academic & Industry Experience**: I bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical implementation
- **End-to-End Solutions**: From concept to deployment, I deliver complete solutions
- **Adaptable Approach**: Whether you need a quick MVP or a robust production system, I tailor my approach to your needs
