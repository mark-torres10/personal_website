## Paper overview

Today's [paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23808985.2021.1976070) is "The role of (social) media in political polarization: a systematic review". As the name suggests, the authors reviewed the existing literature to better understand the impact, if any, that social media has on polarization.

## Key takeaways

## Why did the researchers study this question? What was missing already in the current literature?

## What question(s) is/are being studied by the researchers?

The researchers cite 3 main questions in their paper:

1. How can the current state of research on media and political polarization
be characterized regarding (a) the development of the field over time, and (b) the country of samples?

2. What do we know about media and political polarization in regard to (a) media contents (e.g. is media coverage increasingly
polarized?), (b) media exposure (e.g. do news consumers increasingly use politically polarized media contents?), and (c) media effects (e.g. how can certain types of media exacerbate (or inhibit) political polarization?)?

3. How is polarization discussed and examined in the literature?

## What are their findings? (results)

## What are their conclusions and takeaways? (discussion)

## Why should we care?
