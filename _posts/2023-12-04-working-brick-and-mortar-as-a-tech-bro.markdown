So, in my ~2 month stay in America, I've stumbled upon a volunteer unpaid job as a PM (I guess?) helping my mother and brother run two restaurants.

## Context

## Day in the Life

## Revelations

### Just do it

For everything...

But then I think about how my mother, who came to America as an immigrant escaping poverty in the Philippines, could somehow do just enough of it to survive, and me, a Yale graduate, somehow can't, and I think "OK, I should be able to do it after all."

#### If you're not sure what to do, simplify the problem until you can find something you can do to make progress

### Don't "just do it". Think about what you're doing

### Everything costs money, and everything costs more money when you're a business

A constant complaint that my mother has when talking about the business is about how much it costs to run a restaurant. Once I personally started sorting out the finances, I can see why.

Fun fact: it may cost your local restaurant $400 per month just to get their trash taken out. Don't believe me? Here's a receipt:

$400? I'll do it for free, just give me a truck and I'll drive the trash to the local landfill myself.

I can see why businesses can thrive on providing such niche services as supplying towels or doing laundry. I was shocked by how easily the costs racked up. An individual person may rack up small purchases in the $5 - $20 range that they don't notice, but for a business, these small purchases can instead be $100 - $500 (or more, of course, as a business grows larger).

Payroll also becomes a date to circle every two weeks. As payroll approaches, I need to double-check the bank account and verify that there indeed is enough to cover all of payroll. I now see why both employees and business owners know what day is payroll, but for vastly different reasons.

### Problems are solved with more sales

Rent is too high? Just have more sales. Not enough servers want to join since their tips are too low? Just have more sales. Having to be more stringent about food inventory to reduce food costs? Just have more sales. Unable to afford more workers, even if their work is essential? Just have more sales.

As obvious as it sounds, so many problems can be solved just by having more sales. Profit is affected by both inbound sales and outbound costs, and although in a time of leanness one can cut costs, costs can only be cut to a certain degree, and it will often come with large effort and with a sacrifice to be made in quality. However, costs are less of a problem if one ruthlessly focuses on sales instead. Easier said than done, of course, but it was a revelation to learn just how many everyday problems can be most easily solved with just having more sales.

### The restaurant business (and brick-and-mortar more generally) is the rawest form of a sales negotation and exchange
