> TL;DR: for 99% of people who ask if they should be a data scientist, the answer probably is "no". But, if you're coming in from a quantitative educational background (or have worked in something like consulting or marketing), and you know a little bit of coding (or wouldn't mind spending 2 months figuring it out), then data science is probably a good option to check out!

## Who am I (and disclaimers)

I worked for 2.5 years as a data scientist at a Series A startup (peep the [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-p-torres)). I am by no means a data science expert and I've not had multiple roles in data science. But, from my own experience, first in learning about data science (I recall the "should I learn R or Python for data science" posts fondly), to working in data science professionally, to interviewing candidates for data scientist roles, I've seen different types of people going into data science with different expectations, and reality often doesn't match the expectations. Much of that is due to inaccurate marketing of data science as a field in general. No, it's unlikely you'll be doing cool, cutting-edge machine learning, even though that's what your friend's cousin saw in a bootcamp advertisement video. It's much more likely that you'll be spending time waiting for a piece of code to run or wondering why some column of data has missing values when it shouldn't.

These pictures below give a better idea of what data science actually is (pictures not my own):

## Common misconceptions

### Misconception 1: Data scientists have some of the highest starting salaries in the industry

foo bar

### Misconception 2: Doing this "data science bootcamp" will get me employed in data science

foo bar

### Misconception 3: People are looking for data scientists everywhere, I'm sure I'll get hired immediately

Related to **Misconception 2** above, there's this belief that there's many data science jobs out there, ripe for the taking.

(sure there are some, but they're not for beginners and going to a bootcamp doesn't qualify you normally)

## Broad categories/types of data scientists

### Category 1: Research data scientists

#### Typical educational background: deeply mathematical PhD

This type of data scientist...

more heavy research/highly technical ML/etc.

This does not apply to 99.999% of people who are interested in becoming data scientists but the high salaries of people who are this category of data scientist skew the average data science salary.

### Category 2: More properly a data analyst, but with a fancier title

This type of data scientist...

### Category 3: Product-facing data scientists

To me, this is the "truest" definition of what a data scientist should be. These are data scientists that normally work closely with product or analytics teams.

Some questions that these data scientists are particularly adept at answering are:

1. Are people using our product? Who is using our product? How can we tell that they're using our product?
2. What version of our product are people using? Is there a particular offering that people are liking?
3. What will increase conversion on our product? How does the discount amount offered to customers who closed their shopping session affect conversion rates?

These types of data scientists surface actionable, future-looking insights. They often do experiments and A/B tests and provide statistical insights that can help drive product decisions.

Like in the data analyst role, this one is common for people to transition into if they've worked in product-facing or analytic-facing roles. However, these types of roles are generally much more technical and rigorously quantitative than data analyst roles; they normally require heavy SQL knowledge plus one programming language (normally Python), as well as strong programming chops.

### Category 4: Actually mostly a software/data engineer

This type of data scientist...

## What did I do all day as a data scientist

Nothing (jk...unless...)

## Reasons for being a data scientist

## Reasons for not being a data scientist

## What should I do instead of data science?

### Option 1: Web/app development

### Option 2: Software engineering (more broadly)

### Option 3: Data analysis


### Option 4: Literally anything else
