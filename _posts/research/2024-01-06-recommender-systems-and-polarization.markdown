## TL;DR
It depends, maybe? Research is still inconclusive. At the very least, it's not as obvious as "recommendation algorithms push people to echo chambers which makes them more polarized".

## Definitions

### What is a recommendation algorithm?

#### Why do we need a recommendation algorithm?

#### How do recommendation algorithms work?

#### How do recommendation algorithms curate what you see on social media?

### What is polarization?

#### What polarization is

#### What polarization is not

## How do recommendation algorithms affect polarization?

### What do recommendation algorithms optimize for?

#### What is engagement?

#### How do we measure engagement?

#### Why is engagement something to optimize for?

### Do recommendation algorithms cause more polarization?

#### Yes, they do

#### Actually, maybe not?

#### What else could be causing more polarization on social media? Are recommendation algorithms to blame?

## Looking ahead: what are some ways to improve recommendation algorithms?

### What do we mean by "improve" the recommendation algorithms?

### Recommendation algorithms and the alignment problem
